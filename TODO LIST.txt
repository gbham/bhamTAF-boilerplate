-Ensure using exception error message in output (i.e $"Catch Error: {e.Message})
-Use abstract classes where appropiate
-Add enviromental variables
-Create a "GetWebElements()"
-ensure access modifiers are appropriate
-ensure consistency with either camelCase or PascalCase
-When trying to verify a page has loaded, just use Driver.Title, but ensure there is a 
common element like "Sign In" that can be used too as just the page title wont work as that will be availiable before the elements have loaded
-not sure how many of my "WaitUntilElementIsDisplayedAndEnabled" are actually needed since I have a 'wait' for when each page loads now
-Ensure consistency when using "var element ..." or using a more specific name. It is fine to use just element for the generic functions in WebPage but the
one in ShoppingCartPage for example should maybe be unique like "var commentBox = ...."
-fix issue with catching errors and printing out the correct corresponding element names to identify them by in the logs. A lot of the <a> tags 
have class names with spaces in them so cant use them. One <a> tag I just checked had a title so that may be something I can use. 
-Use LINQ where appropriate
-If I have a GetWebElement() as the first action in a function, then I dont think I need to have a WaitUntilElementDisplayed() at the beginning of the function in question
-Need a better system of loggin exceptions. It needs to be clear in the logs exactly what element/function the exception was thrown from
-Remove session info from the Console.Writeline() output
-Add functionality to take a screenshot when a test fails
